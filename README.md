Hostel Management System (Tkinter GUI)
This project is a Hostel Management System developed using Python's Tkinter library, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for efficient management of various hostel operations. It simplifies the process of managing student information, room allocations, daily in/out movements, and visitor records.

Features
The system offers a range of functionalities to streamline hostel administration:

Student Registration: Easily add new students with comprehensive details, including their first name, last name, father's name, mother's name, date of birth, contact information (which serves as their Hostel ID), email, address, vehicle number, and their associated workplace or college. Students are assigned rooms based on their gender.

Room Management:

Add New Rooms: Create and add new rooms to the hostel, categorized by gender (Male, Female, or Other), ensuring appropriate segregation.

View Available Rooms: Get an instant overview of room availability, displaying which rooms have vacant beds and indicating which beds are occupied.

In/Out Time Tracking: Record and manage student movements with a dedicated system for logging "Out Time" when students leave the hostel (including their purpose) and "In Time" upon their return. This allows for remarks like "On Time," "Before Time," or "Late."

Visitor Management: Maintain a record of all visitors to the hostel. Capture details such as the visitor's name, contact, reason for the visit, address, and the name of the student they are visiting.

Information Retrieval:

View All Student Information: Access a consolidated list of all registered students, displaying their room number, full name, contact, and workplace/college.

Room-Wise Student Details: Quickly retrieve information about students residing in a specific room by entering the room number.
